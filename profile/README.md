# JavaWebStack
JavaWebStack is a collection of libraries which improve your live in Web-Development. It's really easy to use and reduce unnecessarily written code.

### Our most important Libraries:
- [orm](https://github.com/JavaWebStack/orm)
- [http-server](https://github.com/JavaWebStack/orm)
- [http-client](https://github.com/JavaWebStack/http-client)
Or use our [web-framework](https://github.com/JavaWebStack/web-framework) which combines all of our libraries to a simple framework.

### Using it on maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.javawebstack</groupId>
    <artifactId>{Library Name}</artifactId>
    <version>{Library Version}</version>
</dependency>
```
